My claims from the previous post largely is based on the assumption that the global trade will be fragmented into the US allies trading block, Chinese ally trading block (and possibly neutral trading block). 

The naturally rising question is would dollar still be the dominant currency in such a fragmented world? Would Eurodollar market still be functional enough to support the global trade and the dollar regime?
