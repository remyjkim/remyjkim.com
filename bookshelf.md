Here I direct you to some of the best quotes, writings or books that I come back to every year. I hope you find them as insightful as I did.

## Quotes that steer my thinking
* <span style="color: blue">*"The only thing that is constant is change"*</span> - Heraclitus
* <span style="color: blue">*"There are only three ways for humans to change: 1. change the time allocation; 2. change the place of residence; 3. change the people with whom they interact. Only under these three elements can human beings change. One of the most meaningless is: 'Make new resolutions'."*</span> - Kenichi Ohmae
* <span style="color: blue">*"There are three qualities to look for in a partner: intelligence, energy, and integrity."*</span> - Naval Ravikant
* <span style="color: blue">*"Our strategy is to use systems, alter systems, and build systems that expand our circles in ways each of us couldn't do on our own... Uncertainty is a feature of every strategy. Not the delineated steps of a proven process, but the exploration and probabilities of creating a better version of the future."*</span> - Seth Godin
* <span style="color: blue">*"The curious mind embraces science; the gifted and sensitive, the arts; the practical, business; the leftover becomes an economist"*</span> - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
