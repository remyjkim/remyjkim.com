### About Me

I'm a systems thinker at night. I'm obsessed with systems and how to analyze them and how to build sustainable and anti-fragile ones. I write about chokepoints in a complex system and signals that point to their inner workings on my [substack](https://signalsands.substack.com/).

During the day, I'm an entrepreneur and founder of [*Aalps*](https://www.aalpslabs.com), the information capitalism infrastructure of the 21st century. More on what I mean by that [here](https://www.aalpslabs.com/blog/info-capitalism).

In this blog, I share my thoughts on AI, crypto, finance, epistemology, knowledge creation and how they are all connected. The hint is the interplay between signals, perception and value.

Feel free to message me and say hi if you got this far, I donâ€™t bite unless angered. remyjkim8@gmail.com.

Proud alumni of [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) where I was fortunate to study control systems, computer systems and financial systems.

I'm currently on a leave from my graduate studies at [UPenn](https://www.upenn.edu/) where I studied computer science.
