Buckle up, we're living in the most interesting times. A world where geopolitics is being reshaped, intelligent systems are evolving beyond our imagination, and money itself is being reinvented.

I live in New York City and have spent the last year building [*Aalps*](https://www.aalpslabs.com), the information capitalism infrastructure of the 21st century.

I'm a systems thinker at night. I'm obsessed with systems and how to analyze their equilibrium(s) and how to build sustainable and anti-fragile systems. I write about chokepoints in complex systems and signals that point to their inner workings on my [substack](https://signalsands.substack.com/).


Feel free to message me and say hi if you got this far, I donâ€™t bite unless angered. remyjkim8@gmail.com.
