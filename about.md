  Hi, I'm Remy. You can each out to me at remyjkim8@gmail.com.
</p>

<br>

My interest lies in three areas:
1. The non-linear dynamics between the **commodities market** and the **global macro economy**.
2. Cryptographic primitives such as smart contracts and zkSNARKs/MPCs, and their application as a settlement layer for the wider financial system.
3. Decision making under uncertainty and the application of market microstructure theory to the design of financial markets/products.

Here are some of my [*writings*](https://gqkim.notion.site/Remy-s-Writings-62a8e18b2d484b96a180dde4e9556afd?pvs=4) on my journey on the intersection of commodities markets and crypto and how Greekwaters seeks to bridge the two.

I'm a [Seoul Nationl University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) [ECE](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en)/[CBA](https://cba.snu.ac.kr/en) alumni and currently on a leave from my graduate studies at UPenn [CIS](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) to venture into [Greekwaters](greekwaters.io).

Feel free to message me and say hi if you got this far, I donâ€™t bite unless angered.
