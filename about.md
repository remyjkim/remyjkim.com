  Hi, I'm Remy. You can each out to me at remyjkim8@gmail.com.

<br>

#### I'm building [*Aalps*](https://www.aalps.me),
a decentralized commodities value layer that aims to bridge the gap between the traditional commodities market and the crypto ecosystem. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat about commodities, crypto, or anything else.

#### My personal interest lies in three areas:
1. The non-linear dynamics between the **commodities market** and the **global macro economy**.
2. Cryptographic primitives (e.g. smart contracts and zkSNARKs/MPCs) and their application as a **settlement layer** for the wider financial system.
3. Decision making under uncertainty and the application of market microstructure theory to the design of financial markets/products.

#### More about me:
Here are some of my [*writings*](https://aalpsprotocol.notion.site/Aalps-Not-Yet-Official-Blog-afa9a524534241ecb8e4bd51e3dacf23?pvs=4) on my journey on the intersection of commodities markets and crypto and how Aalps seeks to bridge the two.

I'm a [Seoul Nationl University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) [ECE](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en)/[CBA](https://cba.snu.ac.kr/en) alumni and currently on a leave from my graduate studies at UPenn [CIS](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) to venture into [Aalps Protocol](https://www.aalps.me).

Feel free to message me and say hi if you got this far, I donâ€™t bite unless angered.
