<p class="message">
Buckle up, we're living in the most interesting times. A world where geopolitics is being reshaped, intelligent systems are evolving beyond our imagination, and money itself is being reinvented. These forces are colliding and recombining in unprecedented ways. Like it or not, we're in an era of volatility but also extraordinary value and knowledge creation.

I live in New York City and have spent the last year building [*Aalps*](https://www.aalpslabs.com), the information capitalism infrastructure of the 21st century.

I'm a systems thinker at night. I'm obsessed with systems and how to analyze their equilibrium(s) and how to build sustainable and anti-fragile systems. I write about chokepoints in complex systems and signals that point to their inner workings on my [substack](https://signalsands.substack.com/).
