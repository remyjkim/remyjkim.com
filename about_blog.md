I write about chokepoints in complex systems and signals that point to their inner workings on my [substack](https://signalsands.substack.com/).

In this blog, I share my thoughts on AI, crypto, finance, commodities markets, epistemology, knowledge creation and how to best build antifragile systems using them. 

A recurring theme would be the interplay between signals, perception and value.
